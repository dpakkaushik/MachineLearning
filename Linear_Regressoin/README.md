Multiple Linear Regression Projects

**Business problem definition** - One of major automobile company would like to design new product which can improve the sales. Inorder to define the product, they want to understand/identify drivers for the sales (what are the factors driving sales) and Predicting sales of different car models given driving factors.


**Finding the right technique** - Since it is value prediction problem (Regression Problem) so we can use OLS as one of the technique. We can also use other techniques like Decision Trees, Ensemble learning, KNN, SVM, ANN etc but for this particular problem. I am using **OLS** method from package **Statsmodel**
