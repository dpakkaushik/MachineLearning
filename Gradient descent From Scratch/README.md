**Objective:** Here I have created a user defined function for Gradient descent problem and compared the result (Cofficient value for regression function) with Scipy.stats.linregress result.

**Result:** The values using user defined function were turned out to be approximately equal to the values thatwe get using Scipy.stats.linregress.

**Insight:** To further reduce the gap we need to increase the number of iterations.
