Here I have created a user defined function for Gradient descent problem and compared the result (Cofficient value for regression function) with Scipy.stats.linregress result.

The values using user defined function were turned out to be approximately equal to the values thatwe get using Scipy.stats.linregress.

To further reduce the gap we need to increase the number of iterations.
